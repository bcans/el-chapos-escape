# El Chapo's Escape
ECE is an adrenaline-fueled stealth game. You play as a Mexican drug lord inside a maximum security prison. Use the environment, skills, and your years of experience to break out yet again!

This was the final Unity project for my game design course at Florida Tech. I was responsible for the map as well as several scripts and animations.
